Worked on Java problems: Palindrome, FizzBuzz, Pairs, and PrimeNumbers from Structy.

- Faced challenges with Java syntax, especially in Palindrome and Pairs.  
- Learned about `Character.isLetterOrDigit()` and `Character.toLowerCase()`  
- Pairs used 2D arrays, which are new to me

Each problem took around 20 minutes â€” focused on understanding the logic, not speed.

Worked on PairSum Problem from Structy

- Was able to mimic pairs problem
- I only solved the Brute Force Solution
- Got solution from Claude/ChatGPT after trying on paper pseudoCode
- Syntax error again
- Was able to iterate but not able to compute result. **Try again**

Later at night I tried to solve frequencyCounter
- Took long time to understand
- A lot of Java Syntax error but am getting there
- Tried first 30 min writing on paper what is the plan
- Reveiwed with chatGPT after 30min

Worked on OOP for Java

- Syntax is the issue
- Learned how to check if email is valid on setter
- Tried for 15 min
- Get comfortable writing constructor, it is not same as creating new instance of User

Worked on Reversing String and TwoSum Problem
- Brute force method seems simple but again syntax issue
- How do I return a pair without using ArrayList new int[]{i,j};
- Reversing String can be done several way. string s = ch+ s;

## July 12, 2025
- Anagram can be solved by converting them to char
- Put them in Char Array
- Sort them and compare the Array
- This gives n log n time complexity
- HashMap solution gives O(n) time complexity 

## July 13, 2025
- PairProduct was using Brute Force which is checking each number multiplying with following number
- HashMap gives better time complexity
- I had hardtime understanding the hashmap solution
- I understand the idea but lot of syntaxes

## July 14, 2025
- mostFrequent Char is complicated than I expected
- How do I know if I need another helping method?
- Also need to know '\0'
-  if (mostFrequent == '\0' || count.get(c) > count.get(mostFrequent)) this is very tricky, you get the most count not each count

## July 15, 2025
- Reversing a string but the way I thought was to iterate from the back which didnt work because I didn't know where I was going 
- Putting a String for reversed and prepending
- Although this is n^2 solution

## July 16, 2025
- Intersection problem I was able to do Brute Force way and the 4th test was giving error
- I was doing O(n^2) for time complexity
- Also I was using hashmap, put keys and index value making it complicated
- Learned about hashset which is just only Value/Key
- The idea is to use a HashSet to store the values from listA, then loop through listB and check if each element exists in the set. If it does, add it to the result

## July 17, 2025
- Exclusive item was fun. I realized if I can just add those List in a set and then add those set togather then I would get exclusive value
- But it was not that simple. I had to create another hashset for the order.
- Then remove from each other and add the left over.
- This needs another practice


## July 18, 2025
- I know hashset doesn't take duplicates
- I had issue how do I check if two list have dupliates or not
- I converetd items to Set but then went blank
- I think it is the practice that I need
- It checks whether the size of the List and the Set are the same. If they are, it means all elements are unique and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## July 19th, 2025
- I had Capital one interview where the question was related to Kadane's algorithm
- I did Leetcode Maximum Subarray(53) problem
- I also did intersection with duplicates
- This was hard to do, I need to find a keyword that reminds me when i can use the helper method

## July 20th, 2025
- Drained with Code today
- Recursion but not sure if I fully get it. This needs review
- Did Leetcode 11 Container with Most Water as well
- It was tough to understand

## July 21st, 2025
- I did python today instead of Java
- I have an interview tomorrow afternoon
- Not adding anything today since I am focusing on interview preparation

## July 22nd, 2025
- I worked on 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String
- I thought of HashMap but ended up looking the answer
- I have to append using Stringbuilder

## July 23rd, 2025
- Took a different turn than Structy.
- Did Leetcode sliding window problem which is related to HashSet
- Longest Repeating Substring- lc3
- I thought of Hashmap, but that didnt work
- Watched multiple times Nikhil Lohia's explanation
- Tried to write it but watched the code
- Rewrote again without help for git

## July 24th, 2025
- I did recursion today
- It took me a while to understand how it works
- I will do more practice
- Write a method sumNumbersRecursive that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. All elements will be integers. Solve this recursively.
- I wrote factorial without looking it up

## July 25th, 2025
- Had headache but did this sum of String problem anyway
- It was similar to the first recursion issue
- Java Sublist takes time to understand

## July 26th, 2025
- Solved one problem but I wasnt focused much
- I did it anyway

## July 27th, 2025
- Solved Leetcode Problem 128
- Had to watch video on how to get consecutive order
- I was thinking of Binary tree but that won't give O(n) solution
- It is copy paste solution, I surely need more practice

## July 28th, 2025
- Palindrome using recursion
- This sublist in Java is annoying

## August 15th, 2025
- Back at it after a break cause I had knee surgery
- FIboncacci Sequence
- Redid Reverse string
- Redid if the number is prime
-
