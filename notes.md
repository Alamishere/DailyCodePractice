Worked on Java problems: Palindrome, FizzBuzz, Pairs, and PrimeNumbers from Structy.

Faced challenges with Java syntax, especially in Palindrome and Pairs.  
- Learned about `Character.isLetterOrDigit()` and `Character.toLowerCase()`  
- Pairs used 2D arrays, which are new to me

Each problem took around 20 minutes â€” focused on understanding the logic, not speed.
