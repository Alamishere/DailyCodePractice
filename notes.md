Worked on Java problems: Palindrome, FizzBuzz, Pairs, and PrimeNumbers from Structy.

Faced challenges with Java syntax, especially in Palindrome and Pairs.  
- Learned about `Character.isLetterOrDigit()` and `Character.toLowerCase()`  
- Pairs used 2D arrays, which are new to me

Each problem took around 20 minutes â€” focused on understanding the logic, not speed.

- Was able to mimic pairs problem
- I only solved the Brute Force Solution
- Got solution from Claude/ChatGPT after trying on paper pseudoCode

Later at night I tried to solve frequencyCounter
- Took long time to understand
- A lot of Java Syntax error but am getting there
- Tried first 30 min writing on paper what is the plan
- Reveiwed with chatGPT after 30min

Worked on OOP for Java

- Syntax is the issue
- Learned how to check if email is valid on setter
- Tried for 15 min
- Get comfortable writing constructor, it is not same as creating new instance of User

- Anagram can be solved by converting them to char
- Put them in Char Array
- Sort them and compare the Array
- This gives n log n time complexity
- HashMap solution gives O(n) time complexity
