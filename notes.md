Worked on Java problems: Palindrome, FizzBuzz, Pairs, and PrimeNumbers from Structy.

Faced challenges with Java syntax, especially in Palindrome and Pairs.  
- Learned about `Character.isLetterOrDigit()` and `Character.toLowerCase()`  
- Pairs used 2D arrays, which are new to me

Each problem took around 20 minutes â€” focused on understanding the logic, not speed.

Worked on PairSum Problem from Structy

- Was able to mimic pairs problem
- I only solved the Brute Force Solution
- Got solution from Claude/ChatGPT after trying on paper pseudoCode
- Syntax error again
- Was able to iterate but not able to compute result. **Try again**

Later at night I tried to solve frequencyCounter
- Took long time to understand
- A lot of Java Syntax error but am getting there
- Tried first 30 min writing on paper what is the plan
- Reveiwed with chatGPT after 30min
